First, she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind herself where the data came from). Inside that, she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`, which is the date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`, but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years. (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)"

If she used month names, December would come before July; if she didn't use leading zeroes, November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first means that June 2012 will come before June 2013."
