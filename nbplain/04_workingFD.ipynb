Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files.\n\n1. **Don't use whitespaces:** Whitespaces can make a name more meaningful but since whitespace is used to break arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use `-` or `_` instead of whitespace.\n2. **Don't begin the name with `-` (dash):** Commands treat names starting with - as options.\n3. **Stick with letters, numbers, `.` (period or 'full stop'), `-` (dash) and `_` (underscore):** Many other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\n\nIf you need to refer to names of files or directories that have whitespace or another non-alphanumeric character, you should surround the name in quotes (`\"\"`)."

We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.\n\nNo matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you \"Save Asâ€¦\""

However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the **filename extension**, and indicates what type of data the file holds: `.txt` signals a plain text file, `.pdf` indicates a PDF document, `.cfg` is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, `.png` is a PNG image, and so on.\n\nThis is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files contain bytes: it's up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration files, images, and so on.\n\nNaming a PNG image of a whale as `whale.mp3` doesn't somehow magically turn it into a recording of whalesong, though it might cause the operating system to try to open it with a music player when someone double-clicks it."

On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n\n`?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that `p?.pdb` would match `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb` (if we had these two files in the molecules directory), but not `propane.pdb`. We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*` matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character (since the `?` has to match one character, and the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').\n\nWhen the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the molecules directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design."

The goal is to copy the file structure of the `2016-05-18-data` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20-data` and remove the data files from the directory you just created.\n\nWhich of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do?\n\n```bash\ncp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/\nrm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*\nrm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*\n\nrm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*\nrm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*\ncp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-5-20-data/\n\ncp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/\nrm -r -i 2016-05-20-data/\n```\n."

Then two `rm` commands which remove all files in the specified directories. The shell expands the '`*`' wild card to match all files and subdirectories.\n\nThe second set of commands have the wrong order: attempting to delete files which haven't yet been copied, followed by the recursive copy command which would copy them.\n\nThe third set of commands would achieve the objective, but in a time-consuming way: the first command copies the directory recursively, but the second command deletes interactively, prompting for confirmation for each file and directory."
