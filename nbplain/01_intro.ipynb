While such hardware interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still done using screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards."

    "We are all familiar with **graphical user interfaces** (GUI): windows, icons and pointers. They are easy to learn and fantastic for simple tasks where a vocabulary consisting of \"click\" translates easily into \"do the thing I want\". But this magic relies on wanting a simple set of things, and having programs that can do exactly those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to do complex, purpose-specific things it helps to have a richer means of expressing your instructions to the computer. It doesn't need to be complicated or difficult, just a vocabulary of commands and a simple grammar for using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the shell provides - a simple language and a **command-line** interface to use it through.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of a command-line interface is a **read-evaluate-print loop** (REPL) called so because when you type a command and press <Return>. The shell reads it, executes (or \"evaluates\" it), prints the output, prints the prompt and waits for you to enter another command."

    "## The Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "This description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer, and the computer sends output directly to the user. In fact, there is usually a program in between called a **command shell**. What the user types goes into the shell, which then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them. (Note that the shell is called “the shell” because it encloses the operating system in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell is a program like any other. What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs rather than to do calculations itself. The most popular Unix shell is Bash, the Bourne Again SHell (so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows."

    "## Is it difficult?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a different model of interacting than a GUI, and that will take some effort - and some time - to learn. A GUI presents you with choices and you select one. With a **command line interface** (CLI) the choices are combinations of commands and parameters, more like words in a language than buttons on a screen. They are not presented to you so you must learn a few, like learning some vocabulary in a new language. But a small number of commands gets you a long way, and we'll cover those essential few today."

    "## Flexibility and automation\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of commands can be written into a _script_, improving the reproducibility of workflows and allowing you to repeat them easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges."

    "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the North Pacific Gyre, where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. She has 1520 samples in all and now needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the relative abundance of 300 different proteins. The machine's output for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.\n",
    "2. Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a program her supervisor wrote called `goostats`.\n",
    "3. Write up results. Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end of the month so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each sample. The good news is that it only takes two minutes to set each one up. Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel, this step will \"only\" take about two weeks."

    "The bad news is that if she has to run `goostats` by hand, she'll have to enter filenames and click \"OK\" 1520 times. At 30 seconds per sample, the whole process will take more than 12 hours (and that's assuming the best-case scenario where she is ready to enter the next file name as soon as the previous sample analysis has finished). This zero-breaks always-ready scenario is only achieveable by a machine so it would likely take much longer than 12 hours, not to mention that the chances of her typing all of those commands correctly are practically zero. Missing that paper deadline is looking increasingly likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lessons will explore what she should do instead. More specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to automate the repetitive steps in her processing pipeline so that her computer can work 24 hours a day while she writes her paper. As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data."
